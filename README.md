# Idyoms
#### The Information Dynamics of Multidimensional Sequences

Idyoms is a Julia implementation of [IDyOM](https://github.com/mtpearce/idyom) (Information Dynamics of Music) developed by Marcus Pearce. Idyoms implements the multiple-viewpoint, variable-order Markov modelling techniques described by Pearce (2005), and allows them to be applied to arbitrary, non-musical, multi-dimensional sequences of symbols.
